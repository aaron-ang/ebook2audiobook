# Vendored copy of Breeze TTS 2's PyTorch inference code.

#   Upstream:      https://github.com/breezeblue-ai/breeze-tts
#   Model weights: https://huggingface.co/BreezeBlue/breeze-tts-2
#   Code license:  Apache-2.0, preserved verbatim in ./LICENSE. The audio
#                  tokenizer derives from Qwen3-TTS (Alibaba Qwen Team), also
#                  Apache-2.0.
#   Weights:       NOT Apache. Governed by the BreezeBlue Research and
#                  Non-Commercial License, which grants no commercial rights.
#                  Disclosed next to the engine list in this repo's README.
#
# Upstream ships no setup.py/pyproject.toml; this file is local. The only edit to
# upstream source is renaming its `models` module, which collides on install, to
# `breeze_models`.
